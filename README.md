# Syd-Calc
This project is a nology challenge to build on online game. \
I wish I had the technical prowers to develop Crysis4 or Battlefield 6 but I don't. \
So I developed something on my simple level. Naughts & Crosses. \
Hosted at:- https://sydneymurray.github.io/nology-naughts-and-crosses/

## How to build this app
mkdir naughts-and-crosses \
cd naughts-and-crosses \
git clone https://github.com/sydneymurray/nology-javascript-calculator-cypress-testing.git \
npm install
